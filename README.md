In this project I use Gatsby.js in conjunction with Material UI 5. I use a Star Wars type of feel just for getting ideas on how to mix patterns and thoughts that come to mind. I chose Sienar fleet systems as a way to showcase some of their Imperial Starfighters from thier T.I.E. Line of products. Part of this idea came from the Tesla clone site I had made using React. When I do an online tutorial, I redo it in my own way so I learn how to code better. This way I can do my own research and pull in different methods to build upon.
